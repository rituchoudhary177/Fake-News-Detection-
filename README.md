Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & Hybrid Classifiers 

• Developed a machine learning model using hybrid classifiers in which AdaBoost Random Forest attained the highest accuracy of 94%.
• The project followed the CRISP-DM methodology in which NLP techniques were used along with data cleaning methods that were implemented for data preparation.
• Enhanced model accuracy using TFIDF and by Hyperparameter optimization.
• Compared Hybrid classifiers against the Machine learning classifiers
• Used basic EDA techniques like Stemming, Tokenization to extract valuable and relevant features.
